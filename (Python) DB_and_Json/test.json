      "title": "Don Quixote (Dom Quixote)",
      "author": "Miguel de Cervantes",
      "year": 1605,
      "Description": "(from Wikipedia) The plot revolves around the adventures of a noble (hidalgo) from La Mancha named Alonso Quixano, who reads so many chivalric romances that he loses his mind and decides to become a knight-errant (caballero andante) to revive chivalry and serve his nation, under the name Don Quixote de la Mancha. He recruits a simple farmer, Sancho Panza, as his squire, who often employs a unique, earthy wit in dealing with Don Quixote's rhetorical monologues on knighthood, already considered old-fashioned at the time. Don Quixote, in the first part of the book, does not see the world for what it is and prefers to imagine that he is living out a knightly story."

      "title": "Dry Lives (Vidas Secas)",
      "author": "Graciliano Ramos",
      "year": 1938,
      "Description": "(from Wikipedia)  It tells the cyclical story of a family of five: Fabiano, the father; Sinha Vitoria, the mother; two sons (just called boys) and their dog called Baleia (whale in Portuguese) in the poverty stricken and arid Brazilian northeast. One of the distinguishing characteristics of the book is that it is written in said cyclical manner, making it possible to read the first chapter as a continuation of the last chapter, reflecting the cycle of poverty and desolation in the Sertao. Another distinguishing characteristic is that the dog Baleia is considered the most sensible and human character."
